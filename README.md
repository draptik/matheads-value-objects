This is a clone of reveal.js from 2016-10-08 (3c36ee6cff43d2c4aefe59ef5198df4f327fa094).

I removed the original `.git` folder so I could track my changes via git.

My content is located at:

- `slides*.md`

My style changes are located at:

- `index.html` (reference to `slides*.md` and `css/custom.css`)
- `css/custom.css`
