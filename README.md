This is a clone of reveal.js from 2016-10-08 (3c36ee6cff43d2c4aefe59ef5198df4f327fa094).

I removed the original `.git` folder so I could track my changes via git.

My content is located at:

- `content.md`

A pdf version of the slides is located at `pdf/talk-value-objects.pdf`.

My style changes are located at:

- `index.html` (reference to `content.md` and `css/custom.css`)
- `css/custom.css`
